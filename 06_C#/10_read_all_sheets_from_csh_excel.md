If you want to read all sheet names from an **already opened Excel file** and write a value to a specific cell, you'll need to use **Excel Interop** (`Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel`).  

### Steps:
1. Attach to the currently open Excel instance.
2. Get all sheet names.
3. Write a value to a specific cell.
4. Save the workbook.

### Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel** installed. If not, install it via NuGet:
```sh
Install-Package Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel
```

---

### C# Code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Excel = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        try
        {
            // Attach to the running Excel application
            Excel.Application excelApp = (Excel.Application)Marshal.GetActiveObject("Excel.Application");

            if (excelApp == null || excelApp.Workbooks.Count == 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("No open Excel workbooks found.");
                return;
            }

            // Get the active workbook
            Excel.Workbook workbook = excelApp.ActiveWorkbook;

            Console.WriteLine("Workbook: " + workbook.Name);

            // Iterate through all sheets
            foreach (Excel.Worksheet sheet in workbook.Sheets)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Sheet: " + sheet.Name);

                // Write a value to cell A1
                sheet.Cells[1, 1] = "Hello, Excel!";
            }

            // Save workbook
            workbook.Save();
            Console.WriteLine("Data written successfully.");
        }
        catch (COMException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Excel is not running or no workbook is open.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Attach to the running Excel instance** using `Marshal.GetActiveObject("Excel.Application")`.
2. **Check if an Excel workbook is open**; otherwise, exit.
3. **Get all sheets** from the active workbook.
4. **Write "Hello, Excel!" into cell `A1`** for each sheet.
5. **Save the workbook** without closing Excel.

### Notes:
- This approach **does not** open a new Excel instance. It **modifies the currently open file**.
- The user **must have Excel open** before running this program.
- Make sure Excel is running in the **same privilege level** as your application (e.g., both as Administrator or both as a normal user).
